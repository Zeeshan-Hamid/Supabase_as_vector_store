The prime location keeps Downtown busy throughout the year. Constantly attracting tourists, there’re always some new things to do in Downtown Dubai.\nThe area is best known for offering a luxurious lifestyle. As per Bayut’s 2020 Rental Market Report, it is the second most popular area offering luxury apartments for rent after Dubai Marina. Downtown is well connected to other key commercial and residential areas in the city.\nStrategically located along Sheikh Zayed Road, E11, across Al Wasl and bordering Business Bay, it is a pretty active and bustling neighbourhood. Downtown is one of Dubai’s best areas for non-drivers and frequent travellers. Many amenities, including upscale hotels, chic leisure points and massive shopping centres, make Downtown Dubai a sought-after address and “the centre of now.”",
